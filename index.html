<h1> Plastic Fishing </h1>

<p>  This game was inspired by ocean life. Made this game board with a masonite board and painted it to give the sand a graininess to the project. The kelp was made with sculpey clay and glued on with tissues to make the game board more 3D and interactive. The board characters, made with plaster and have been painted on are sea animals that have been infected by plastic and have to escape.  </p>
