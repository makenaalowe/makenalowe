<h1> In The Moment </h1>
<p> In this sketch I started to work with custom functions and the translation functions. <br>
<p>
  This was my first time attempting speedX, speedY, loX, loY; create my own creature <br>
  In this sketch I attempted to use the for loop for the first time using mouseX and mouseY, push and pop and function with the body part name.
  Frank moves floats up with a yellow square. <br>
